# sprucebot-cli
Hey, I'm Sprucebot! This CLI was designed to give you the tools you need
to help brick-and-mortar businesses thrive in the Internet age. Once I'm
up and running in a store, you'll be able to react to real world events, such
as guests entering or leaving.

Once your skill is ready and making an impact, you can submit it to the
Skills Marketplace so other boutiques, bars, retailers, etc. can start
taking advantage of it.

Remember, our goal is to connect people, not replace them. So make
sure your skill promotes human-to-human connection.

# Skills Development
Skills are how you give me new... well, skills. A skill is really analogous to
an app. It needs to be fully featured and create a real world experience people remember.
Keep in mind as you're out saving small business that the thing that makes
brick-and-mortar unique is the fact that real people are interacting face-to-face.

It's the ultimate social network, and with your skills giving me the power to
facilitate amazing experiences, brick-and-mortar, ma and pa shops will live long into the future. ðŸŒ²ðŸ¤–

### Prerequisites
* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation
* ~~`yarn add -g sprucebot-cli`~~

### Skill Commands

* `sprucebot skill create "[Skill Name]"`
  * Creates a directory called: skill-${skill-name}
  * Everything is lowercased. [^a-z0-9] are converted to dashes "`-`"
  * All subsequent commands require you to be in the skill's directory
  * `cd sprucebot-skill-${skill-name}`
* `sprucebot skill listen [event-name]`
  * Adds a listener to your skill. 
  * Events are lower cased, seperated by dashes "`-`"
  * Creates `./events/event-name.js`
  * Core Events: 
    * ~~will-enter~~
    * did-enter
    * ~~will-leave~~
    * did-leave
    * ~~will-message~~
    * ~~did-message~~
    * ~~will-update-profile~~
    * ~~did-update-profile~~
  * Custom events are namespaced, such as `vip:will-send`
    * Creates `./events/vip/will-send.js`
    * Jump in and start editing
* `sprucebot skill ignore [event-name]`
  * Removes a listener and moves the callback file.
  * `./events/did-enter.js` -> `./events/disabled/did-enter.js`
* `sprucebot skill [get|post|patch|delete] "[route/path]"`
  * Sets up a callback and returns instructions with stub for implimentation
  * Example: 
  * `sprucebot skill get "/admin/:someVariable/test"`<br />
      Route created. <br />
      Add this to your desired controller (or create one) inside `./controllers/${anything}.js`<br />
      modules.export = {<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"get /admin/:someVariable/test": (sb, req, res) {<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log('hello world', req.params.someVariable)<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
* `sprucebot skill page /path`
  * Creates a react route and corresponding page stubbed with a React component
  * Example: `/guest/profiles/:profileId/bookings/:bookingId` generates `/pages/guest/profiles/bookings.js`


### Developer Guidelines
* See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/sprucelabsai/sprucebot-cli/blob/dev/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the rules around skill development.

# Simulating Real World Events
When your skill needs to respond to different events (enter, leave), you need to simulate them locally.

* `sprucebot simulator start`

Once the simulator is running, you can press different keys to simulate events. Instructions are displayed after you start the simulator.
